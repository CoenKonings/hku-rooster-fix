# HKU Rooster Fix
This project contains a Django application that allows users to select courses and groups for year 2 of music technology at Utrecht University of the Arts, and creates an icalendar feed for those groups to remove clutter from their schedules. Refer to requirements.txt for the libraries that were used during development.

## Planned features
