# HKU Rooster Fix
This project is a webapp dat allows users to create custom ical feeds for courses from the music technology programme at Utrecht University of the Arts. This allows users to remove the groups that they are not a part of from their schedule, removing clutter and improving clarity. In the end, this helps students organise their time more efficiently, and prevents them from overlooking changes in the schedule.
